# Song-recommender
This project was created for a CS-65 class. The idea behind this project is that it provides the user with 5 songs it recommends for them based on different preferences and criteria such as in what decade the song was created, its danceability, artist, genre, tempo, etc. After that, the user can rank how many songs they liked which makes the program calculate its accuracy.

The project was created with two classmates : Maala Membe and Tino Chigwada in December of 2020. No started code was provided.
